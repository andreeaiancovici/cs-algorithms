/**
 * Question:
 * Given an array of nâˆ’1 integers in the range from 1 to n, find the one number that is missing from the array.
 * Assume the array is non-empty.
 * ---
 * Solution:
 * Applying XOR between 2 identical numbers will result 0.
 * Compute XOR result from 1 to n.
 * Compute XOR result from input array.
 * Computer XOR between the 2 result found earlier.
 * The only number which won't be XOR-ed with its duplicate is the one that is missing.
 * ---
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
